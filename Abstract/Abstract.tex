    \section{Abstract}
	The software design study gives the student the opportunity to work in a team (typically 5 or 6 students) on a challenging and substantial software design project. This will normally include mainly the early phases of the software lifecycle (requirements analysis and software design), but may also include the further development of prototype software and/or demonstration software.\\
